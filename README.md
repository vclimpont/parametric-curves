# Parametric curves

This project is a programming exercise that implements multiple algorithms in order to work around parametric curves.

## Cubic Hermite spline

The equation of the cubic hermite interpolation allows to plot a curve using *P0* as its starting point, *P1* as its ending point and *V0* and *V1* as their respective tangents.
